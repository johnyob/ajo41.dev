My personal website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Development

> [!NOTE]
> `ajo41.dev` is built with Nix, a package manager and system configuration tool that makes building from sources easy! See the [Nix docs](https://nixos.org/download/) for instructions for your system. Additionally, ensure [Nix flakes are enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes).

To get started locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
❯ git clone https://github.com/johnyob/ajo41.dev.git && cd ajo41.dev
# Enter the Nix development environment
❯ nix develop
# Install dependencies and start dev server
❯ npm install
❯ npm run dev
```

Additional commands:

```bash
❯ npm run format    # Format code with Prettier
❯ npm run build     # Build for production
❯ npm run lint      # Run linting
```
